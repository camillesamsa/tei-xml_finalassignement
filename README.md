Jules Verne, born in 1828 in Nantes and died in 1905 in Amiens, was a renowned French writer. Before becoming famous for his novels, he began his career writing plays and newspaper articles. His first novel, *Cinq semaines en ballon*, published in 1863, marked the launch of his literary career, followed by several famous works including *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers* (1869), *Le Tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours* (1873), and *L'Île mystérieuse* (1874).

## Project Goals

### Cataloging Historical Correspondence
Jules Verne's letters contain valuable insights into his personal life, professional relationships, and creative process. By structuring these letters according to TEI guidelines, the collection becomes more accessible, searchable, and easier to analyze within the scholarly community.

### Preserving Authenticity
TEI's rich encoding system preserves the original format of the letters while allowing modern readers and researchers to interact with the content without altering its historical context. Through TEI, the unique features of Verne’s letters, such as handwritten annotations or formatting details, can be represented with precision.

### Enhancing Accessibility
Presenting Verne’s letters in a TEI-compliant format enhances the ability to identify and explore literary, personal, and socio-historical patterns. By encoding the text in a standard that prioritizes both accessibility and scholarly rigor, researchers can more easily discern relationships and themes across the correspondence.

## Benefits of Using TEI

TEI offers a flexible and comprehensive way to structure historical texts. With TEI, each part of a letter—such as the header, body, and signature—can be clearly tagged and annotated, making the content easier to study in its own right while also enabling sophisticated searches. Unlike simple XML, TEI is specifically designed for the complexities of literary texts and historical documents, offering the capacity to encode not just the words, but also contextual information like authorship, dates, places of writing, and recipients. This feature greatly enhances automatic analysis and exploration, allowing for in-depth scholarly research.
